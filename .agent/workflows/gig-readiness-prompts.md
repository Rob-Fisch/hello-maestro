# Gig Readiness Prompts (Future Feature)

## Concept
"Tickle" the user with contextual prompts to share the band link at key moments.

## Trigger Moments

| Trigger | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| Date confirmed | "Lock it in! Share the gig details with your band" |
| All slots filled | "Band's set! Send everyone the final lineup" |
| Rehearsal upcoming | "Rehearsal tomorrow — remind the band" |
| 1 week before gig | "Gig in 7 days — share the setlist one more time?" |
| Day before | "Tomorrow's the day — send last-minute details" |
| Set list added | "Setlist ready! Share with the band" |

## UI Ideas
- Action Board at top of Stage page
- Banner or card on individual gig view
- Badge on Stage hub card from Home

## Why It Works
- Data already exists (dates, slots, setlists)
- Calculation is simple (compare dates to today)
- UI is lightweight (one card/banner)
- No backend needed (client-side logic)

## Growth Opportunity
Each share of the band link = organic exposure to OpusMode for non-users.
