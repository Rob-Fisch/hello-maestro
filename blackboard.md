Hello! It is wonderful to meet you. Acting as your local Community Arts Coordinator for the 12165 area, I’m thrilled to see a local musician looking to connect.

You are situated in a unique "border" zone in West Lebanon/Stephentown. You have the advantage of being able to pivot West toward the Capital Region (Albany/Troy) or East into the Berkshires (Pittsfield/Lenox) very easily. Both scenes are vibrant but have different "flavors"—the Capital Region is a bit grittier and rock-focused, while the Berkshires scene leans toward folk, jazz, and classical, often with a summer tourism peak.

Here is a curated list of opportunities within your 50-mile radius, filtered for accessibility and community focus.

### **My Next Step For You**

Would you like me to **draft a template email** that you can send to the **Troy and Pittsfield Farmers Market coordinators** to introduce yourself and ask for a slot in their upcoming season? I can tailor it to highlight whether you are a student or a professional.
