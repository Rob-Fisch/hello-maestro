## 🚨 Critical: Multi-Device Sync Safety

| # | Pri | Issue | Description | Status | Created |
|---|-----|-------|-------------|--------|---------|
| 33 | 1 | **Sync Overwrites Stale Data** | Current `fullSync` pushes ALL local data via upsert, regardless of whether it's newer than cloud. If you edit on iPhone, then open iPad with stale cache, iPad sync will overwrite iPhone's changes. Need version/timestamp comparison before push. | ⬜ | 01-28 |

**Mitigation options:**
1. Add `version` column, reject pushes where local version < cloud version
2. Compare `updatedAt` timestamps before push, skip if cloud is newer
3. Conflict detection UI for user resolution

## ⏭️ Next Session

- [x] **Plain-Language Pricing Copy** — ✅ Completed 2026-01-25. Rewrote landing page copy using everyday language. New hero: "OpusMode: The Missing Toolkit For Musicians". Replaced Navigator references with AI benefit language, simplified pricing features, used "leads" instead of "gigs".

### Chord Chart Builder Details
- **Problem**: iReal Pro is overkill; Notes apps are too crude
- **Entry Philosophy**: Click-first, minimal typing. Tap cells on grid → pick chord from palette
- **Templates**: 12-bar blues, 8-bar verse, AABA, custom
- **Features**: Section labels, repeat signs, key/tempo header, transpose function
- **Optional lyrics**: Interleave lyric lines under chord rows
- **Output**: Scrollable view, print-ready PDF, share link
- **⚠️ Wireframe first**: Create mockups before implementation

### PDF Viewer Details
- **Problem**: Export PDF → find in Downloads → open externally = too much friction
- **Solution**: Swipeable card view, render PDFs inline with `react-pdf` or PDF.js
- **⚠️ Prototype first**: Validate rendering performance on mobile Safari
