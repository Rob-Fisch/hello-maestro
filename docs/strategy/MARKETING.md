## The "10-Pack" Bridge Strategy

**Concept**: Bridge the gap between Free and Pro users with one-time purchases.

When users hit limits, they can:
1. Buy a 10-pack to extend (e.g., $10 for 10 Navigator queries)
2. Or see all the benefits of subscribing

**Current Implementation**:
- Navigator Query Pack: $10 for 10 queries (never expires)
- Link appears after first query showing usage + "Buy 10-Pack"

**Future Expansion Ideas**:
- Set List Pack (when hitting 5 template limit)
- Song Library Pack (when hitting 50 song limit)
- Storage Pack (when hitting 100MB limit)

## Products Page Concept

**Problem**: Current 10-pack links go directly to checkout. Users don't see the upgrade comparison.

**Proposed Solution**: Create a Products page that shows:
- Current 10-pack options
- Pro subscription benefits
- Side-by-side comparison: "Do I buy another pack, or subscribe?"

**Goal**: Turn limit-based frustration into upgrade opportunities.

## Early Adopter Program

**Status**: Needs planning

**Questions to Answer**:
- How many adopters per cohort?
- What feedback do we want from them?
- What do they get in return? (Free Pro for X months? Lifetime discount?)
- How do we evaluate success?

**Feedback Loop Ideas**:
- Staged Google Forms (Day 1-7, Day 30+, Evergreen)
- In-app feedback prompts for promo users
- Settings link: "Give Feedback"

**Early Adopter Feedback Form**: https://forms.gle/7EjgccfTkXNNszVh7
