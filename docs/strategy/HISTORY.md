# OpusMode: The Story So Far

> *An app built by a musician, for musicians, one discovery at a time.*

## Origins

**December 19, 2025** — The first commit. What started as "Hello Maestro" — a simple practice session logger — quickly revealed bigger possibilities.

The original idea was modest: a way to track practice time and notes. But as development progressed, a question kept surfacing: *"What else do musicians need?"*

## Key Milestones

### December 2025 — The Foundation

- **Dec 19** — First commit as "Hello Maestro"
- **Dec 22** — Rebranded to **OpusMode**
- **Dec 26** — Added Gear Vault, PWA support, and unified cross-platform storage

The calendar emerged as a natural organizing principle. Practice sessions needed dates. But so did gigs. And rehearsals. And lessons. Suddenly, the humble practice logger transformed into something bigger.

### January 2026 — The Platform Takes Shape

- **Gig Management** became the central feature — the thing musicians actually needed most
- **Set Lists** and **Song Library** evolved to support real-world performance workflows
- **Contacts** and **Messaging** connected band members and venue managers
- **Financial tracking** brought the business side into view
- **Pro tier** launched with cloud sync and premium features

### The Road Ahead

OpusMode continues to evolve, shaped by real musician needs and real-world feedback. The journey from practice logger to performance platform is far from over.
